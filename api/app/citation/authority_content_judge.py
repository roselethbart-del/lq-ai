"""Whole-body authority content judge (WS-E PR1c, SUPPORTED tier).

For an authority blockquote (statute / regulation) that did not match a
fetched authority body verbatim, ask an LLM judge whether the passage is
faithfully supported by the *whole* fetched body — the SUPPORTED tier.
Reuses the cascade's judge surface (``_JudgeGatewayProtocol``) and response
parser; conservative bias (a false-positive verification is worse than a
false-negative). Cost-bounded by a per-message budget enforced in the
authority orchestrator (``verify_and_persist_authority_citations``).

Mirrors :mod:`app.citation.case_content_judge` (the caselaw B1b judge); the
only differences are the ``lq_ai_purpose`` tag (segregated cost calibration)
and authority-appropriate naming. The judge prompt itself is the shared
generic ``build_judge_prompt`` (claim vs. source chunk), which applies
equally to statutory/regulatory text.
