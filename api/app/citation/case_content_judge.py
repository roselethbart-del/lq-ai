"""Whole-opinion caselaw content judge (DE-280, P1-B1b).

For a caselaw blockquote that did not match any consulted opinion verbatim,
ask an LLM judge whether the passage is faithfully supported by the *whole*
opinion text (10-50pp) — the SUPPORTED tier. Reuses the cascade's judge
surface (``_JudgeGatewayProtocol``) and response parser; conservative bias
(a false-positive verification is worse than a false-negative). Cost-bounded
by a per-message budget enforced in the caselaw orchestrator.

Unlike Stage 3 (``verify_paraphrase``), which feeds a ±200-char window
around the cited span, this judge feeds the *entire* opinion text so the
LLM can locate support anywhere in the document. That is appropriate for
caselaw paraphrase checks: a holding may be stated once, elaborated
elsewhere, and the blockquote may conflate both — a narrow window would miss
the elaboration. The cost estimate accounts for the longer context.
